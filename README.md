# DimRed: Unveiling Data Insights with Dimensionality Reduction

DimRed is a Python library designed to uncover hidden patterns, simplify datasets, and accelerate analysis using various dimensionality reduction techniques. From Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), DimRed offers a range of advanced methods for exploring high-dimensional data in a more manageable and interpretable form.

## Features

- **Multiple Techniques**: Explore a variety of dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, Incremental PCA, Kernel PCA, t-SNE, and more.
- **Simplify Analysis**: Reduce the complexity of high-dimensional datasets while preserving important information and patterns.
- **Visualize Data**: Visualize the transformed data in lower dimensions to gain insights and identify clusters or trends.
- **Accelerate Processing**: Speed up the analysis process by reducing the number of features while maintaining data integrity.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install DimRed using pip:

```
pip -r install requirements.txt
```
