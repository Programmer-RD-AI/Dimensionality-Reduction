# DimRed: Advanced Dimensionality Reduction Toolkit

Welcome to DimRed, the comprehensive Python toolkit for applying advanced dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance machine learning model efficiency and effectiveness. Our toolkit includes a variety of dimensionality reduction methods, tailored to simplify the complexities of high-dimensional data, making it easier to visualize, analyze, and gain insights from your data.

## Key Features

- **Versatile Reduction Techniques**: Implements well-known methods like PCA, SparsePCA, KernelPCA, and emerging techniques such as Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding.
- **Enhanced Model Training**: Integrates with popular machine learning libraries including sklearn, xgboost, and lightgbm to evaluate the performance impact of each dimensionality reduction method.
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Utilizes Weights & Biases for real-time tracking and analysis of model performance.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Our rigorous testing framework ensures that each method is evaluated for maximum performance improvement.
